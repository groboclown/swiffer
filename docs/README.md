# Creating Workflows with swiffer-decider

With `swiffer-decider`, you define workflows as a collection of
[tasks](task.md) that define what the workflow needs to do, along with
[pipelines](pipeline.md) that define the order in which the workflow does them.

You also can construct the workflow [execution order at runtime](logic.md)
based on previous events in the workflow.
